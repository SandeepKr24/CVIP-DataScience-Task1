# CVIP-DataScience-Task1

You don't need to manually download the data for this. I used the opendatsets library to download and read the data directly from Kaggle as it was over 100mb in size and github was not letting me upload it. You will need your Kaggle api key to download the dataset using this notebook from Kaggle automatically. So, before you begin just make sure that you have it handy.

This notebook contains Exploratory Data Analysis about the global terrorism events in the time period from 1970 to 2017.
